    Personal Favorite (PSF) is an internet social media site designed to help you get the word 
    out about your events/favorite things and others can find new activities to participate. 
    Whether it is a new local event happening or a trending seasonal recipe you want to share. 
    Maybe a new book came out that you feel hasn't gotten enough traction yet. 
    Use PSF to find and share your personal favorites.
