### Elevator pitch

Have you ever been bored or lacking creativity and don't know where to go? Maybe just google things to do, but are bothered by random websites filled with ads. Scroll on social media? But find yourself sitting in bed for hours. Personal Favorite has the goal of getting you out of your house to do things. Want to find parties going on? Check what parties are popular around you. A new video game or sport is starting to get popular? Find out what others are playing and maybe find a new friend to do it with.
