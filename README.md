# Personal Favorite
[My Notes](notes.md)

Personl Favorite is a social media website where you can post you're favorite activities, recipies and more. Vote and share youre favorites to see what is trending. Create a profile to post or vote on others posts. Learn about local activities and find new people to go with. 


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever been bored or lacking creativity and don't know where to go? Maybe just google things to do, but are bothered by random websites filled with ads. Scroll on social media? But find yourself sitting in bed for hours. Personal Favorite has the goal of getting you out of your house to do things. Want to find parties going on? Check what parties are popular around you. A new video game or sport is starting to get popular? Find out what others are playing and maybe find a new friend to do it with.
